            <p>
                Hello there, my name is Jordan Else, I am currently
                teaching myself web development through The Odin
                Project and this is my personal page, which will be
                updated with better looks, designs and features as my
                skills progress. I will also be listing my projects 
                and experience here as well as about me as a person.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Currently I am empolyed by Tesco, when I am not working
                either there or on my development I am exploring my 
                other hobies. I am an avid gamer, having done so from 
                the start of my teenage years, I also enjoy baking and
                making ice cream! Hopefully recipes for my strangest
                flavours will be listed on a webiste with a link here.
                To offset that you will also find me frequently hitting
                the gym. Another passion of mine is learning Finnish, 
                my dream one day would be to move there.
            </p>
