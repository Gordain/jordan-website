        </div>
        <div>
            Hello there, my name is Jordan Else, I am currently
            teaching myself web development through The Odin
            Project and this is my personal page, which will be
            updated with better looks, designs and features as my
            skills progress. I will also be listing my projects 
            and experience here as well as about me as a person.
        </div>
        <div>
            Currently I am empolyed by Tesco, when I am not working
            either there or on my development I am exploring my 
            other hobies. I am an avid gamer, having done so from 
            the start of my teenage years, I also enjoy baking and
            making ice cream! Hopefully recipes for my strangest
            flavours will be listed on a webiste with a link here.
            To offset that you will also find me frequently hitting
            the gym. Another passion of mine is learning Finnish, 
            my dream one day would be to move there, but it is not
            the goal.
