        Hi, my name is
        Jordan Else
        About me
        Hello there, my name is Jordan Else, I am currently
        teaching myself web development through The Odin
        Project and this is my personal page, which will be
        updated with better looks, designs and features as my
        skills progress. I will also be listing my projects 
        and experience here as well as about me as a person.

        Currently I am empolyed by Tesco, when I am not working
        either there or on my development I am exploring my 
        other hobies. I am an avid gamer, having done so from 
        the start of my teenage years, I also enjoy baking and
        making ice cream! Hopefully recipes for my strangest
        flavours will be listed on a webiste with a link here.
        To offset that you will also find me frequently hitting
        the gym. Another passion of mine is learning Finnish, 
        my dream one day would be to move there, but it is not
        the goal.
